After the meeting that I just got out of, I found that I required a fair
amount of walking around to get my head in order. An associate offered
to lend an ear if I needed someone to talk to. Right now I think I just
need someone to tell the following:

1.  I am a reasonably competent individual
2.  There is nothing about this issue that I cannot overcome
3.  The act of actually killing someone does nothing to educate them
4.  Getting upset over someone who does not know any better just makes
    me upset, and this accomplishes nothing
5.  Getting upset at someone 300 miles away for less than an act of war
    is useless.

OK, now I feel a little better. I don't know if that is from having
taken the really brisk walk through the office, or intentionally walking
slow enough to be able to watch the little kids that someone brought
into the office. Kids are wonderfully calming, when they are being good,
or are in awe of a modern American office building.

"Mom, can I climb up these stairs? No, how about these other ones?"

Deep, relaxing exhale.

No I just need to find something to make blowup. The joy of video games
during lunch.
