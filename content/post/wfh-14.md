I have been a little busy, but I did want to note that today is the 14th anniversary of my starting to work from home.

April 1, 2008, was the day I moved out of the last office building where I had a dedicated space.  People couldn't tell if my moving out of that office was some sort of April Fool's Day joke.  A few, if I remember correctly, actually expressed some degree of panic that maybe I had lost my job.  

April 4, 2008 was the first day I started working from home full-time.  I know working from home is not something that is all that special these days, after two years of the global pandemic, but I still wanted to post something about having done it for so long.

So, here I am, fourteen years later.

I don't know if I would even be able to really go back to an office.  I've worked remotely, I don't know _HOW_ I would go back to the office.  Fortunately, the company I work for has made a commitment that we would, as a default, all work from home.

So, here's to fourteen years.  Can someone remind me, what does it look like outside?  I really haven't left the house that much recently.
