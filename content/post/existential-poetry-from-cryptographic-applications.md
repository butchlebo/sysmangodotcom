The wisdom one finds in key fingerprints:

    beeswax almighty
    newsletter revenge atmosphere
    drunken suspicious glitter
    blockade insurgent pheasant retrieval 
    rematch stupendous puppy
    Scotland, Medusa dropper
    December reindeer yesteryear
    provincial waffle sympathy
    Tub jail ally till Joan them
    ow near toot lop caw fool
    volt core pin mad cry doll
    seal Jane cube tour slew Ruth
    Hurt mars
    end bait blew wane
    them edgy IRA lend block stew
    beeswax almighty

Is this not beautiful.
