I know I said that March 1 was the 21st anniversary of the site, but the actual date of the first post was March 23.

The post on the 1st was added later becuase Sam wanted to see something on the calendar widget that the site used to show.

I am out of the habit of posting anything to this site.  I would like to change that.
