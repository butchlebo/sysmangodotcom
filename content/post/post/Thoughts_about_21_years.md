I know I said that March 1 was the 21st anniversary of the site, but the actual date of the first post was March 23.

The post on the 1st was added later becuase Sam wanted to see something on the calendar widget that the site used to show.

I am out of the habit of posting anything to this site.  I would like to change that.

Right now the limiting factor to keeping this blog going, to actualy writing more, is time.

I am not comcerning myself that much with the current state of social media.  The map of how I used to use social media?  This is what it looked like in 2009:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10271567@N05/3363872519/" title="Social Network Map"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3612/3363872519_c27ff5b9aa_z.jpg" width="640" height="463" alt="Social Network Map"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The map of actual use from 2012:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10271567@N05/7218953400/in/album-72157629778775540/" title="Social Network Map v 6"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7071/7218953400_6fcafef0fc_z.jpg" width="640" height="308" alt="Social Network Map v 6"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Or the map from 2012 that showed _every_ social media site I had ever used:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10271567@N05/7218954770/in/album-72157629778775540/" title="Social Network Map  v7"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7087/7218954770_b0ba0176c9_z.jpg" width="640" height="432" alt="Social Network Map  v7"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From a quick count, 18 of those sites are no longer operating.  A few I've stopped using a few others.
