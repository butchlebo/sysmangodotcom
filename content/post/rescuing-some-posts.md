As I mentioned in the [yesterday's post](http://sysmango.com/node/1),
there were a few posts that the boys insisted that I carried forward to
the new site.

Here is the listing of posts, for your amusement. May whatever gods you
believe in have mercy on your soul.

-   [On Apathy](/post/on-apathy)
-   [Personal Hells](/post/personal-hells)
-   [Existential Poetry from Cryptographic Applications](/post/existential-poetry-from-cryptographic-applications)
-   [A weird morning if ever there was one](/post/a-wierd-moring-if-ever-there-was-one)
-   [Why today is Thursday](/post/why-today-is-thursday)
-   [Sam's First Day 9th Grade](/post/sams-first-day-9th-grade)
-   [An open letter to Jake's Teachers](/post/open-letter-jacob-teachers)

Share and enjoy.
