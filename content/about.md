## About SysMango.com

SysMango.com is a personal website and blog where I share my thoughts, experiences, and projects. The name "SysMango" reflects my interests in systems engineering and technology.

## Technologies

SysMango.com is currently built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static site generator. The site uses a custom theme based on Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.

Previously, SysMango.com was powered by Drupal 5.15 (until around 2012) and before that, it utilized a free release of [MovableType](https://www.movabletype.org/).

The site integrates with various services:
- Photos are managed through [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)
- Code repositories are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/butchlebo)
- Social media updates from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) (now X)
